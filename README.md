## Instructions

To play our game and utilize the computer vision aspect, you need to have python installed.
You are also going to need some python libraries.
To download the libraries easily, you can run this command from the 701gameProject directory (You must have pip installed for this to work):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, you need to run the one of the two computer vision scripts. hr_with_emotions.py contains the both stress and emotion detection, while hr.py only contains stress detection. Try running hr_with_emotions.py first, however if you have compatability or performance issues you should run hr.py instead. To run the script, run this command from the 701gameProject directory:

```bash
python hr_with_emotions.py
# or
python hr.py
```

Once you have the script running, you can open up the build in 701gameProject.
